## 🌟 Project Overview

**OMEGA (Options Market Efficiency & Generative Analysis)** is an institutional-grade quantitative trading system designed specifically for the Indian NSE Nifty 50 index options market. Unlike generic Black-Scholes calculators found on GitHub, OMEGA is built to handle the unique, non-linear characteristics of the Indian market:

-   **"Rough" Volatility**: Nifty's volatility often exhibits a Hurst exponent $H < 0.5$, meaning price paths are rougher/noisier than standard Brownian motion.
-   **Fat Tails**: Frequent "gap" openings due to global cues (SGX Nifty, Fed rates) which standard Gaussian models underestimate by 40-50%.
-   **Event Risk**: Specific pricing logic for RBI Monetary Policy, Union Budgets, and Election results.
-   **Liquidity Skews**: Realistic modeling of bid-ask spreads that widen for OTM options (the "Smile").
-   **Arbitrage**: The Indian market is *not* perfectly efficient. OMEGA identifies transient arbitrage opportunities (Box spreads, Butterflies) that exist for < 5 minutes.

The system combines **Rigorous Mathematics** (Stochastic Calculus, PDEs) with **Modern AI** (Gradient Boosting, LLM Sentiment Analysis) and **Software Engineering Rigor** (Golden Master Tests) to identify mispriced options with high probability.

### Core Philosophy
1.  **Don't Predict Direction**: Predicting where Nifty goes is hard (50/50).
2.  **Predict Volatility**: Predicting that Nifty will move *somewhere* is easier.
3.  **Price the Wings**: Retail traders overpay for deep OTM Lotteries. We sell them using scientifically calibrated surfaces.
4.  **Protect the Downside**: Use Jump-Diffusion to price the specific risk of a 10% lower circuit crash.

---

## 💎 Why OMEGA v6? (The Institutional Edge)

Most retail traders lose money because they buy options based on directional hunches ("Nifty will go up") without knowing the **Fair Value**. They overpay for volatility and get crushed by Theta decay.

OMEGA solves this by answering three critical questions that retail platforms don't ask:

1.  **What is the True Price?**
    *   *Standard*: Black-Scholes (assumes constant volatility).
    *   *OMEGA*: Heston Stochastic Volatility + Merton Jump Diffusion + SVI Surface + VRP Filter.

2.  **Is it Cheap or Expensive?**
    *   *Standard*: "IV is high."
    *   *OMEGA*: "Deep OTM Calls are 2-sigma cheap relative to the realized Variance Risk Premium of the last 10 days."

3.  **What is the Probability of Profit?**
    *   *Standard*: Delta (approximate).
    *   *OMEGA*: 50,000 Monte Carlo simulations using Sobolev Quasi-Random sequences to map the exact payoff distribution.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The codebase is organized into a hierarchical 4-layer stack. Each layer abstracts complexity from the one above it.

### Layer 4: The Interface (`opmAI_app.py`)
The Streamlit-based dashboard. It acts as the "Trader's Desk".
-   **Data Ingestion**: Upstox API (Live), Angel One API (Historical).
-   **State Management**: `MarketState` class that acts as the "Single Source of Truth".
-   **Visualization**: Plotly charts for Volatility Surfaces, Payoff Diagrams, and Greeks.
-   **Execution Logic**: Paper trading simulation and Strategy Builder.

### Layer 3: The Intelligence (`omega_model.py`)
The decision-making layer ("The Brain").
-   **ML Correction**: A Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost/LightGBM) that predicts the *error* of the mathematical model based on 50+ features.
-   **Anomaly Detection**: An Isolation Forest that filters out "fake" mispricings caused by stale data or illiquidity.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Integration with Gemini/Perplexity to quantify "Market Mood" from news.

### Layer 2: The Pricing Core (`nirv_model.py`)
The "NIRV" (Nifty Intelligent Regime-Volatility) model ("The Heart").
-   **Regime Detection**: A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that classifies the market into 4 regimes (Bull-Low Vol, Bear-High Vol, etc.).
-   **SVI Surface**: Stochastic Volatility Inspired parameterization to model the smile/skew accurately.
-   **Monte Carlo Engine**: A Sobol-sequence accelerated-MC pricer handling Heston dynamics + Merton Jumps.
-   **VRP State Filter**: Introduced in v5 and extended in v6 to model-free VRP term structure.

### Layer 1: The Quant Engine (`quant_engine.py`)
The mathematical toolbox ("The Tools").
-   **SABR**: Dynamic calibration algorithms.
-   **HestonCOS**: Fourier-Cosine expansion for semi-analytical pricing (millisecond latency).
-   **GARCH**: Volatility forecasting tools.
-   **Optimization**: Differential Evolution and Least Squares solvers for calibration.
-   **Feature Flags**: `omega_features.py` manages the activation of new experimental mathematics.

## 🚀 The 12 Quantitative Upgrades (Phase 2 & 3)

This system implements 12 distinct "institutional-grade" upgrades over standard retail models. These are implemented in `quant_engine.py` and validated via `backtester.py`.

### 1. Dynamic SABR Calibration
Standard models use a fixed Volatility Surface. OMEGA recalibrates the **SABR** (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho) model in real-time for every expiry slice.
*Benefit*: accurately prices OTM "wings" where retail traders often get trapped.

### 2. GJR-GARCH(1,1) Forecasting
Unlike simple historical volatility, GJR-GARCH accounts for the **Leverage Effect** (volatility rises more when prices fall).
*Benefit*: Superior prediction of future volatility during market crashes.

### 3. Heston COS Method
A semi-analytical pricing method using Fourier-Cosine series expansion.
*Benefit*: **50x faster** than Monte Carlo, allowing for real-time scanning of the entire option chain (100+ strikes) in sub-second time.

### 4. EM-Based Jump Diffusion
Uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate the probability and size of market "jumps" (gap openings).
*Benefit*: Prices "Crash Put" options correctly, which BSM severely underprices.

### 5. ML Signal Pipeline
An XGBoost classifier trained on 50+ features (Greeks, Flows, Technicals) to predict the probability of an option trade being profitable.
*Benefit*: Filters out mathematically "cheap" options that are actually "value traps".

### 6. Neural Volatility Surface
(Phase 3 Experimental) A neural network that learns the residuals of the SABR surface to capture idiosyncratic market microstructure effects.

### 7. Continuous VIX Regime Detection
Instead of hard thresholds (e.g., VIX > 20), this uses a continuous sigmoid function and HMM probabilities.
*Benefit*: Smooth transitions between strategies (e.g., gradually shifting from Short Straddle to Long Straddle).

### 8. Enhanced LSM (American Pricing)
Longstaff-Schwartz Method with **Chebyshev Polynomials** and **Importance Sampling**.
*Benefit*: Accurate pricing for American-style options (though Nifty is European, this allows for pricing stock options if needed).

### 9. Kelly Criterion Sizing
Automatically calculates the optimal bet size based on the model's confidence and win probability.
*Formula*: $f^* = \frac{p \cdot b - q}{b}$ (adjusted for fractional Kelly to reduce drawdown).

### 10. Bayesian Posterior Confidence
Adjusts the model's confidence based on liquidity (Bid-Ask Spread) and historical accuracy.
*Benefit*: Reduces confidence in illiquid, wide-spread options where "mid-price" is unreliable.

### 11. Portfolio Greeks Optimization
Uses Linear Programming to hedge a portfolio to be Delta-Neutral, Gamma-Neutral, and Vega-Neutral simultaneously.

### 12. Cross-Asset Signal Processing
Monitors lead-lag relationships between:
- **US 10Y Yield** vs Nifty
- **CBOE VIX** vs India VIX (Overnight spillover)
- **USDINR** vs Nifty IT Index

## ⚡ The v6 Feature Stack (Phase 4, 5 & 6)

Version 5.0 introduces "Paradigm Shift" upgrades that address the root causes of model failure in live trading.

### 1. Synthetic India VIX (`india_vix_synth.py`)
**Problem**: The official NSE India VIX feed often freezes or updates with a 15-minute delay.
**Solution**: OMEGA calculates its own "Synthetic VIX" in real-time by inverting the option chain variance spread (Variance Swap replication).
*Alpha*: You know the true volatility regime *before* the rest of the market.
*Derivation*: $VIX^2 \approx \frac{2}{T} \sum_i \frac{\Delta K_i}{K_i^2} e^{RT} Q(K_i)$

### 2. Arbitrage-Free Surface (`arbfree_surface.py`)
**Problem**: Raw SVI calibration can produce "Butterfly Arbitrage" (negative probability density) deep OTM.
**Solution**: A post-processing layer that enforces:
   - $g(k) \ge 0$ (No negative probabilities)
   - $w(t_2) \ge w(t_1)$ (Total variance must increase with time)
*Alpha*: Prevents the model from buying "impossible" options that only look cheap due to bad math.

### 3. VRP State Filter (`vrr_state.py`)
**Problem**: Heston assumes mean reversion $\kappa$ is constant. In reality, Fear decays faster than Complacency.
**Solution**: We define the **Variance Risk Ratio (VRR)**:
   $$ VRR_t = \frac{IV_t}{RV_{t, 10d}} $$
   - If $VRR > 1.5$ (Fear): $\kappa$ is boosted (volatility will crash down fast).
   - If $VRR < 0.8$ (Complacency): $\kappa$ is lowered (volatility will act sticky).
*Alpha*: Captures "Vol Crush" profits after events (Budget, Earnings).

### 4. Surface Shock Generator (`surface_shock.py`)
**Problem**: How do we know if our portfolio survives a 20% VIX spike?
**Solution**: A generative model that applies "shocks" to the SVI parameters ($\rho$ becomes more negative, $a$ shifts up) to simulate crash scenarios.
*Alpha*: Stress-tests your book against 2008 or 2020 style crashes.

## 🔬 Scientific Methodology & Mathematics

This section details the core mathematical models used in `nirv_model.py` and `quant_engine.py`.

### 1. The Heston Stochastic Volatility Model
We assume the spot price $S_t$ and variance $v_t$ follow:

$$ dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sqrt{v_t} S_t dW_1 $$
$$ dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t) dt + \sigma_v \sqrt{v_t} dW_2 $$

Where:
- $\mu$: Drift (Risk-free rate - Dividend yield)
- $\kappa$: Mean reversion speed of volatility
- $\theta$: Long-run average variance
- $\sigma_v$: Volatility of volatility (Vol-of-Vol)
- $\rho$: Correlation between $dW_1$ and $dW_2$ (typically around -0.6 for Nifty)

The Heston model captures the **volatility clustering** and **leverage effect** (negative correlation between spot and vol) observed in Nifty.

### 2. Merton Jump Diffusion
To handle gap risks (e.g., overnight gaps due to US markets), we add a Poisson jump process $J$:

$$ \frac{dS_t}{S_t} = (...) dt + (...) dW_1 + (e^J - 1) dN_t $$

Where $N_t$ is a Poisson process with intensity $\lambda$ (average jumps per year), and $J \sim N(\mu_J, \sigma_J^2)$ describes the jump size distribution.

### 3. SVI (Stochastic Volatility Inspired) Parameterization
Used for constructing the Volatility Surface $\sigma_{BS}(k, T)$:

$$ w(k) = a + b \left[ \rho(k - m) + \sqrt{(k - m)^2 + \sigma^2} \right] $$

Where $w(k) = \sigma_{BS}^2 T$ is total variance, and $k = \log(K/F)$ is log-moneyness.
- **$a$**: Vertical shift (overall vol level)
- **$b$**: Slope of the wings (fat tails)
- **$\rho$**: Skew (rotation)
- **$m$**: Horizontal shift (ATM skew)
- **$\sigma$**: Smoothness/Curvature (smile bottom)

**Calibration**: We use `scipy.optimize.minimize` (L-BFGS-B) to fit these 5 parameters to live market data every minute, minimizing the RMSE between model IV and market IV.

### 4. Bayesian Confidence Score
We compute a posterior probability of mispricing:

$$ P(Mispriced | Data) \propto P(Data | Mispriced) \cdot P(Mispriced) $$

Where $P(Data | Mispriced)$ assumes gaps are uniformly distributed (anything is possible), while $P(Data | Efficient)$ assumes gaps follow a Normal distribution $N(0, \text{spread})$. If the gap is significantly larger than the bid-ask spread (3-sigma event), the posterior probability of mispricing jumps to > 90%.

## 🏆 Golden Master Testing Methodology

In v6, the project continues using strict **Regression Testing** as a non-negotiable quality gate.

1.  **The Snapshots**: We created 5 JSON files in `tests/golden/snapshots/` representing diverse market conditions:
    *   ATM Call (Normal)
    *   OTM Put (Crash protection)
    *   ITM Call (Deep liquidity)
    *   High VIX (Panic)
    *   Low Liquidity (Far OTM)
2.  **The Promise**: Every commit is run against these snapshots.
3.  **The Rule**: If `Current_Price - Snapshot_Price > 0.01`, the test FAILS.
4.  **Reproducibility**: We use `np.random.seed(42)` and `use_sobol=False` (or fixed standard RNG) in the Golden tests to ensure bit-exact reproducibility.

To run the Golden Master tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/golden/test_golden_nirv_outputs.py -v
```

## 📖 User Guide & Workflows

### Workflow 1: Intraday Mispricing Scan
1. Open the dashboard (Tab 1).
2. Click **"Refresh Market Data"** in the sidebar.
3. Wait for the `MarketState` to update (approx. 2-3 seconds).
4. Navigate to **Tab 2 (Option Chain)**.
5. Look for the **Heatmap**.
   - **Green Cells**: Model estimates typically > Market Price (Potential Buy).
   - **Red Cells**: Model estimates < Market Price (Potential Sell).
6. Check the **"Confidence"** column. Only trade if Confidence > 70%.
7. Use the "Filter" sidebar to hide low-confidence strikes.

### Workflow 2: Constructing a Strategy
1. Identify a mispriced strike in Tab 2 (e.g., 23500 Call is cheaply priced).
2. Go to **Tab 3 (Strategy Builder)**.
3. Select "Long Call" or build a spread (e.g., "Bull Call Spread").
4. Select the specific strikes.
5. View the **Payoff Diagram**.
6. Check the **"NIRV Probability"**. Is P(Profit) > 55%?
7. If satisfied, execute in Paper Trading (Tab 5) or your real broker.

### Workflow 3: Post-Market Analysis
1. Go to **Tab 4 (Analysis)**.
2. Check the **Volatility Surface** plot.
   - Is there a "Smirk" (Skew)? This indicates high Put demand (Bearish sentiment).
   - Is the surface flat? (Calm market).
3. Check the **OI Buildup**. Are writers fleeing or adding positions?
4. Run `python3 backtester.py` to see how the model *would have performed* today if you had auto-traded.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Errors

**Q: `ImportError: No module named 'quant_engine'`**
A: Ensure you are running Python from the root directory of the project. Python needs to see the current folder in `sys.path`. Do not run from inside a `src` folder if one exists (this project is flat).

**Q: Upstox Login Failed**
A:
1. Check if `UPSTOX_API_KEY` in `config.env` is correct.
2. Ensure usage of the correct Redirect URI (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
3. You may need to generate a new `access_token` if the old one expired (tokens valid for 24h).
4. If checking strictly on weekends, markets are closed, so live feed will return empty.

**Q: "SVI Calibration Failed" Warnings**
A: This happens when the market data for an expiry is messy or illiquid (e.g., far-month expiries). The system automatically falls back to the previous successful calibration or broad defaults. It is safe to ignore unless it happens for the *current* expiry.

**Q: Backtest results are all 0.**
A: Check if `SyntheticNiftyGenerator` is producing valid prices. Ensure `n_days` is > 10 to allow indicators (RSI, HV) to warm up.

### Performance Tuning

**Q: The dashboard is slow.**
A:
- Reduce `N_PATHS` in the sidebar from 50,000 to 10,000.
- Switch "Pricing Model" from `NIRV (Monte Carlo)` to `HestonCOS (Semi-Analytical)`. This will speed up pricing by 50x.
- Disable "Deep Analysis" in the AI tab.

## Appendix C: Kelly Criterion Derivation

The Kelly Criterion maximizes the geometric growth rate of capital.
If we invest a fraction $f$ of our bankroll, our wealth after $n$ trades is:

$$ W_n = W_0 (1 + fb)^S (1 - f)^F $$

Where $S$ is number of successes, $F$ is number of failures.
Taking logarithms and differentiating with respect to $f$:

$$ \frac{d \ln(W_n)}{df} = \frac{S b}{1 + fb} - \frac{F}{1 - f} = 0 $$

Solving for $f$:

$$ f^* = \frac{p(b+1) - 1}{b} = \frac{pb - q}{b} $$

In OMEGA, we use a **"Half-Kelly"** strategy ($f^*/2$) because parameter uncertainty (estimation error in $p$) makes Full Kelly too risky.

## Appendix D: Mathematical Derivations

### D.1 The SVI Raw Parametrization
The Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) model parametrizes the implied variance slice as:

$$ w(k) = a + b \{ \rho(k-m) + \sqrt{(k-m)^2 + \sigma^2} \} $$

To ensure no arbitrage:
1.  **Non-negative variance**: $a + b\sigma \sqrt{1-\rho^2} \ge 0$
2.  **Smile Convexity**: $b \ge 0$
3.  **Slope constraint**: $| \rho | < 1$

### D.2 Heston Characteristic Function
The analytical price of a Heston call option is given by:

$$ C(S, K, T) = S P_1 - K e^{-rT} P_2 $$

Where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are probabilities obtained by calculating the inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic function $\phi(u)$:

$$ \phi(u) = \exp \left( C(u, \tau) \theta + D(u, \tau) v_0 + i u \ln S_t \right) $$

OMEGA uses the **Albrecher (2007)** stable form for $D(u, \tau)$ to prevent numerical blow-ups for large maturities:

$$ D(u, \tau) = \frac{-d + \rho \sigma u i + \kappa}{\sigma^2} \left[ \frac{1 - e^{d\tau}}{1 - g e^{d\tau}} \right] $$

Where $d = \sqrt{(\rho \sigma u i - \kappa)^2 + \sigma^2 (u^2 + ui)}$.

### D.3 Variance Risk Ratio (VRR)
The VRP State Filter defines market regime based on the spread between Implied Volatility ($IV$) and Realized Volatility ($RV$).

$$ VRR_t = \frac{IV_{ATM, 30d}}{RV_{Close-Close, 10d}} $$

- **$VRR > 1.2$**: Market is paying a high premium for insurance. Strategy: Credit Spreads / Iron Condors.
- **$VRR < 0.9$**: Market is underpricing risk. Strategy: Long Straddles / Gamma Scalping.
- **$0.9 < VRR < 1.2$**: Normal regime. Strategy: Directional plays.

## Appendix F: OMEGA v6 Release Delta (Compared to v5)

This appendix documents what changed in v6, why those changes were introduced, and how to safely activate them without breaking the v5 baseline behavior.

### F.1 Upgrade Philosophy

v6 follows a strict engineering policy:

1. Baseline compatibility first.
2. New behavior is feature-gated and default OFF unless correctness requires otherwise.
3. Golden regression must continue to pass with new features disabled.
4. Any advanced mode must remain CPU-friendly on MacBook when requested.

### F.2 Core v6 Additions

| Area | File(s) | v6 Capability | Activation |
|------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Contract Specs | `nse_specs.py` | Expiry/lot/tick resolution with contract master support | `USE_NSE_CONTRACT_SPECS` |
| VIX Engine | `model_free_variance.py`, `india_vix_synth.py` | NSE-style model-free variance with minute interpolation | `USE_NSE_VIX_ENGINE` |
| Tail Handling | `model_free_variance.py` | Conservative tail correction for sparse wings | `USE_TAIL_CORRECTED_VARIANCE` |
| Surface | `essvi_surface.py`, `svi_fixed_point.py`, `surface_checks.py` | eSSVI + warm-start + arbitrage diagnostics | `USE_ESSVI_SURFACE`, `USE_SVI_FIXED_POINT_WARMSTART` |
| VRP State | `vrp_state.py` | Model-free VRP term structure and slope-state logic | `USE_MODEL_FREE_VRP` |
| Pricer Routing | `pricer_router.py`, `nirv_model.py` | Tiered routing Surface→COS→QMC under CPU budget | `USE_TIERED_PRICER` |
| ML Uncertainty | `omega_model.py` | Conformal intervals for correction confidence | `USE_CONFORMAL_INTERVALS` |
| Research Filter | `omega_model.py` | 9/10-10/10 conviction-only output mode | `USE_RESEARCH_HIGH_CONVICTION` |
| OOS Reliability | `omega_model.py` | Blocks BUY/SELL if out-of-sample reliability is weak | `USE_OOS_RELIABILITY_GATE` |

### F.3 Why the Research Filters Exist

A common failure mode in options models is over-trading medium-quality signals. v6 introduces two filters:

1. Conviction Filter:
- Converts directional outputs into a strict 10-point conviction framework.
- In research mode, only 9/10 or 10/10 candidates remain actionable.

2. OOS Reliability Gate:
- Looks at tracked historical outcomes.
- Rejects new directional calls if recent out-of-sample hit rate and signed edge are weak.

These filters reduce frequency and improve selectivity. They do not guarantee profits.

---

## Appendix G: Full Feature Flag Reference (v6)

The table below is the canonical reference for all active feature flags.

| Flag | Default | Scope | Description | Typical Use |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `india_vix_synth` | OFF | Legacy | Enable legacy synthetic VIX path | Legacy comparison only |
| `arb_free_surface` | OFF | Legacy | Enable legacy arbitrage repair path | Legacy comparison only |
| `vrr_state` | OFF | Legacy | Legacy VRR filter in NIRV | Compatibility checks |
| `surface_shock` | OFF | Legacy | Legacy surface shock generator | Stress-test studies |
| `USE_NSE_CONTRACT_SPECS` | OFF | v6 | Contract master for expiry/lot/tick/time | Correct NSE spec behavior |
| `USE_NSE_VIX_ENGINE` | OFF | v6 | NSE-consistent model-free variance engine | Better RN variance state |
| `USE_TAIL_CORRECTED_VARIANCE` | OFF | v6 | Conservative tail extrapolation for sparse wings | Sparse option chains |
| `USE_ESSVI_SURFACE` | OFF | v6 | eSSVI surface as primary smile model | Arbitrage-stable surface |
| `USE_SVI_FIXED_POINT_WARMSTART` | OFF | v6 | Fixed-point warm start for faster SVI calibration | Faster calibrations |
| `USE_MODEL_FREE_VRP` | OFF | v6 | VRP term structure (7/30/60d) and slope state | Regime-aware adaptations |
| `USE_TIERED_PRICER` | OFF | v6 | Router for Surface IV, COS, and selective QMC | Better speed/accuracy tradeoff |
| `USE_CONFORMAL_INTERVALS` | OFF | v6 | Prediction intervals around ML residual correction | Actionability filtering |
| `USE_RESEARCH_HIGH_CONVICTION` | OFF | v6 | Keep only 9/10-10/10 conviction candidates | Research-only strict scans |
| `USE_OOS_RELIABILITY_GATE` | OFF | v6 | Block directional calls if tracked OOS performance is insufficient/weak | Reliability-first filtering |

### G.1 Runtime Overrides

Feature flags can be controlled in three ways:

1. Programmatic:
```python
from omega_features import set_features
set_features(USE_TIERED_PRICER=True, USE_CONFORMAL_INTERVALS=True)
```

2. Environment JSON:
```bash
export OMEGA_FEATURES_JSON='{"USE_TIERED_PRICER":true,"USE_NSE_VIX_ENGINE":true}'
```

3. Streamlit Sidebar:
- Open `OMEGA v6 Feature Flags`
- Toggle flags
- Click `Refresh Models` when needed

### G.2 Recommended Profiles

#### MacBook Profile
- Targets responsive scans.
- Enables key v6 components without fully uncapped CPU usage.

#### Max Accuracy
- Enables deeper correction stack and tail corrections.
- Higher CPU cost than MacBook profile.

#### Max Results (Research)
- Enables high-conviction filter and OOS reliability gate.
- Intended for low-frequency, high-selectivity analysis.

---

## Appendix H: Runtime Profile Details and CPU Budgeting

### H.1 CPU Budget Semantics

The CPU budget is a soft budget per option for tiered pricing.

- Low budget (for example 8 ms):
  - Prefers fast tiers.
  - Suitable for full chain scans.

- Medium budget (for example 50-120 ms):
  - Allows deeper refinements.
  - Good for shortlist validation.

- High budget (for example 500-2000+ ms):
  - Prioritizes accuracy over throughput.
  - Research mode / deep candidate analysis.

### H.2 Tier Routing Summary

Tier 0:
- Price from surface-implied volatility using Black-Scholes.
- Fastest.

Tier 1:
- HestonCOS refinement.
- Balanced speed and robustness.

Tier 2:
- Selective Sobol QMC Heston+Jump MC with control variates.
- Slowest but highest model flexibility.

### H.3 Control Variates Used in Tier 2

- Black-Scholes price.
- HestonCOS price.

These reduce variance of MC estimate and stabilize candidate ranking.

## Appendix I: Research High-Conviction Mode and OOS Gate

This section explains the two strict research filters in practical terms.

### I.1 Conviction Score Behavior

Conviction score emits only three values:

- `10`: Strong multi-factor directional edge.
- `9`: Actionable directional edge.
- `0`: Not actionable for strict research selection.

Inputs include:

- Absolute mispricing strength.
- Physical probability quality.
- Confidence level.
- Efficiency score.
- ML confidence.
- Conformal actionability status.

### I.2 OOS Reliability Gate Behavior

Directional signals are allowed only when tracked outcomes satisfy thresholds.

Default gate controls:

- Minimum sample count.
- Minimum global directional accuracy.
- Minimum global signed edge.
- Optional side-specific constraints (BUY vs SELL).
- Optional regime-specific constraints.

When gate fails:

- Directional signal is downgraded to `HOLD`.
- Gate reason is surfaced in output metadata.

### I.3 Why This Is Better Than Forcing 9/10 for Everything

Artificially forcing all scores to 9-10 damages ranking quality and introduces false confidence.

Strict filtering instead:

- Preserves signal integrity.
- Reduces low-quality trades.
- Improves reproducibility of decision logic.

### I.4 Important Limitation

Even strict gating cannot provide guaranteed profits.

This is a probabilistic decision engine under non-stationary market conditions.

## Appendix L: Streamlit Runtime Behavior and Caching

### L.1 Model Caching

The app caches heavy model initialization with `st.cache_resource`.

Cached factories:

- `_get_cached_nirv_model(...)`
- `_get_cached_omega_model(...)`

Cache invalidation uses:

- feature signature
- refresh nonce

### L.2 Avoiding Unnecessary Recalibration

The design intent is:

- avoid expensive recalibration on every widget change,
- trigger refresh on underlying/expiry/profile changes,
- allow explicit manual refresh.

### L.3 Safety Controls

The app includes:

- strict-live-data block,
- emergency kill switch,
- synthetic fallback telemetry.

These are useful for disciplined workflows even in research mode.

---

## Appendix M: Honest Usage Guidance

### M.1 What OMEGA is Good At

- Ranking options by modeled relative edge.
- Filtering low-quality opportunities.
- Building reproducible, testable signal pipelines.
- Providing model diagnostics and uncertainty context.

### M.2 What OMEGA Cannot Do

- Guarantee profits.
- Remove market regime shift risk.
- Remove execution slippage/latency risk.
- Predict exogenous shocks with certainty.

### M.3 Practical Best Practices

1. Use high-conviction + OOS gate for shortlist generation.
2. Start with paper trading and outcome tracking.
3. Review spread/liquidity before any manual trade.
4. Track realized edge drift and recalibrate thresholds.
5. Prefer fewer high-quality trades over many marginal trades.

### M.4 Suggested Research Workflow

1. Enable `Max Results` profile.
2. Scan chain.
3. Keep only PASS entries with 9/10 or 10/10 conviction.
4. Manually verify market microstructure (spread, depth, event context).
5. Log post-trade outcomes to strengthen OOS gate quality.

---

## Appendix N: Extended FAQ (v6)

### N.1 Why do I get many HOLD signals in strict research mode?

Because filters are intentionally selective. HOLD dominance is expected in high-selectivity mode.

### N.2 Why can a high mispricing still be blocked?

Mispricing alone is insufficient. OOS gate may block when recent tracked reliability is weak.

### N.3 Should I always enable tail correction?

No. Keep it off unless wings are sparse/truncated and chain quality supports correction.

### N.4 Which profile is best for MacBook day-to-day usage?

Start with `MacBook Profile` for responsiveness.

### N.5 Which profile is best for deep weekend research?

Use `Max Results` with a higher CPU budget.

### N.6 How do I tune OOS gate strictness?

Pass threshold kwargs into pricing/scan calls:

- `oos_min_samples`
- `oos_min_accuracy_pct`
- `oos_min_avg_edge_pct`
- `oos_min_side_samples`
- `oos_min_regime_samples`
- `oos_lookback`

### N.7 Does this code execute live trades by default?

No. It is primarily analysis and decision support unless explicitly integrated with execution paths.

### N.8 Are old v5 outputs still reproducible?

Yes, with flags off and golden tests passing.

### N.9 Can I run this without GPU?

Yes. The stack is CPU-oriented and designed for MacBook execution.

### N.10 Is this suitable for beginners?

Only if used cautiously. The system is advanced and assumes understanding of options risk.
